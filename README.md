# Metro Nav

Style and script to decorate an HTML navigation list as a Metro-style user interface. Inspired by the navigation menu used on the [Jurassic WOrld pre-release website](http://islanublar.jurassicworld.com/) and by the [Metro UI Start screen template] (https://metroui.org.ua/templates/start-screen.html).
